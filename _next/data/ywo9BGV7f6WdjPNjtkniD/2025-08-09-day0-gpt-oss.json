We also introduce a free online playground featuring both web and API access to the GPT-OSS-120B model ([chat.eigenai.com](https://chat.eigenai.com)) in partnership with Yotta Labs. Major performance optimizations are already in the pipeline, and we expect to offer even faster, smarter, and more scalable services in the days ahead.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction of GPT-OSS Architecture\n\nGPT-OSS is a newly released open-source large language model (LLM) from OpenAI designed for the efficient deployment of reasoning tasks. OpenAI open-sourced two versions of GPT-OSS: [GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b/blob/main/README.md).\n\n- **GPT-OSS-120B**: for production, general purpose, high reasoning use cases (117B parameters)  \n- **GPT-OSS-20B**: for lower latency, and local or specialized use cases (21B parameters)  \n\nFigure 1 illustrates the architectural details.\n\n![GPT-OSS Architecture](/images/blog/2025-08-09-day0-gpt-oss/arch.png)\n\n**Figure 1.** Illustration of GPT-OSS architecture. GptOssMoE layers and GptOssAttn (sinked sliding window grouped-query attention) layers.\n<br><br>\n\n---\n\n### GptOssAttn\n\nGPT-OSS introduces a novel attention mechanism that interleaves sliding window attention and full attention. Specifically, odd-numbered layers use sliding window grouped-query attention (GQA) with a window size of 128, and even layers use full attention. All attention layers include bias terms in the linear projection layers (queries, keys, values, and output). A distinctive sinked attention mechanism is applied: for each attention head, a learnable scalar parameter (referred to as the sink) is appended as the last column of the attention score matrix **S** prior to softmax. After softmax computation, the sink column is detached, yielding a standard square attention matrix **A**. This operation is mathematically equivalent to modifying the softmax denominator with an additional exponential term.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2025-08-09-day0-gpt-oss/eqn1.png\"\n     alt=\"Attention Sink Mechanism\"\n     style=\"width:200px; height:auto;\">\n\n**Why Attention Sinks?** Incorporating a single learnable parameter into each attention head allows the model to disregard all tokens as necessary. By introducing a sink, attention is diverted from other tokens, thereby restricting the propagation of information (and potential noise), which yields more consistent embeddings. This stability is particularly vital for the effective operation of sliding window attention. The model card for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20B details this attention sink mechanism, explicitly linking the design to our prior investigations, namely StreamingLLM [1] and SpAtten [2].\n\n![StreamingLLM Figure](/images/blog/2025-08-09-day0-gpt-oss/streamingllm.png)\n**Figure 2.** Within MIT-HAN-Lab's StreamingLLM [1], the initial \"sink\" tokens are retained in the cache, facilitating generation of unlimited length by adhering to the model's inherent attention dynamics.\n\nThe methodology employed in StreamingLLM learns a full token embedding that is capable of varying interactions with each query (as illustrated in Figure 2), whereas OpenAI implements a solitary learnable value functioning as a universal release mechanism. Both strategies effectively address the core challenge: providing an outlet for attention when no substantive focus is required.\n\n![SpAtten Figure](/images/blog/2025-08-09-day0-gpt-oss/spatten.png)\n**Figure 3.** Initial tokens are always kept in SpAtten [2].\n<br><br>\n\nA similar phenomenon has been observed in BERT, where a surprisingly large amount of attention focuses on the delimiter token [SEP] and periods. Our work SpAtten [2] in 2021, which pioneered attention score-based KV Cache pruning and quantization of attention, also found that GPT-2 preserved its initial token, as shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe attention sink mechanism discovered has since been adopted across the industry, appearing in production systems like OpenAI's models and inspiring new research directions in quantization and model optimization.\n<br><br>\n\n---\n\n### GptOssMoE\n\nFor Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, each token selects the top-4 experts based on router scores from 128 (for 120B) or 32 (for 20B) experts. The expert adopts **SwigLU** activation, and three linear layers, including gate, up, and down projections, all have bias terms enabled. The gate branch employs a **Swish** activation function with β = 1.702, and the up branch is added by 1 and multiplied with the gate output. To ensure numerical stability:\n\n- The gate pre-activation is clipped at a maximum value of 7 before applying Swish.  \n- The up branch is clipped to the range [−7, 7] before the +1 shift.\n\nThe MoE computation is summarized as:\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2025-08-09-day0-gpt-oss/eqn2.png\" alt=\"MoE Computation\" style=\"width:400px; height:auto;\">\n\nThe outputs of the top-k selected experts will be summed up with the softmax-normalized router weights.\n\n<img src=\"/images/blog/2025-08-09-day0-gpt-oss/eqn3.png\" alt=\"MoE Output\" style=\"width:300px; height:auto;\">\n\n---\n\n## Try Local GPT-OSS Serving on Hopper/Blackwell GPUs\n\nPlease follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/8833) to set up a ready-to-use container to try out GPT-OSS serving.\n<br><br>\n\n---\n\n## Introducing the Eigen AI Playground\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce the launch of the **Eigen AI Playground**, built in partnership with Yotta Labs – a free online platform where anyone can experience the power of OpenAI’s GPT-OSS-120B model right in their browser: [chat.eigenai.com](https://chat.eigenai.com).
