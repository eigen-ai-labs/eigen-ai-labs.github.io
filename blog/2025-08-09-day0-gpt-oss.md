In this blog, we're excited to achieve day 0 support for the serving of OpenAI’s GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B on Hopper/Blackwell GPUs in collaboration with the SGLang team. We also introduce a free online playground featuring both web and API access to the GPT-OSS-120B model ([chat.eigenai.com](https://chat.eigenai.com)) in partnership with Yotta Labs. Major performance optimizations are already in the pipeline, and we expect to offer even faster, smarter, and more scalable services in the days ahead.

## Introduction of GPT-OSS Architecture

GPT-OSS is a newly released open-source large language model (LLM) from OpenAI designed for the efficient deployment of reasoning tasks. OpenAI open-sourced two versions of GPT-OSS: [GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b/blob/main/README.md).

- **GPT-OSS-120B**: for production, general purpose, high reasoning use cases (117B parameters)  
- **GPT-OSS-20B**: for lower latency, and local or specialized use cases (21B parameters)  

Figure 1 illustrates the architectural details.

### GptOssAttn

GPT-OSS introduces a novel attention mechanism that interleaves sliding window attention and full attention. Specifically, odd-numbered layers use sliding window grouped-query attention (GQA) with a window size of 128, and even layers use full attention. All attention layers include bias terms in the linear projection layers (queries, keys, values, and output). A distinctive sinked attention mechanism is applied: for each attention head, a learnable scalar parameter (referred to as the sink) is appended as the last column of the attention score matrix **S** prior to softmax. After softmax computation, the sink column is detached, yielding a standard square attention matrix **A**. This operation is mathematically equivalent to modifying the softmax denominator with an additional exponential term.

**Why Attention Sinks?** Adding just one learnable parameter per attention head enables the model to "pay no attention to any tokens" when needed. The presence of a sink draws attention away from other tokens, limiting the spread of information (and noise) and resulting in more stable embeddings, which is especially critical for the stability of sliding window attention. OpenAI's model card for GPT-OSS-20B explains the attention sink mechanism, directly connecting the design to our research, i.e., StreamingLLM [1] and SpAtten [2].

![StreamingLLM Figure](/images/blog/2025-08-09-day0-gpt-oss/streamingllm.png)
**Figure 2.** In our StreamingLLM [1], the first few "sink" tokens are kept in the cache, which has unlocked infinite-length generation by respecting the model's existing attention patterns.

Our approach in StreamingLLM learns a full token embedding that can interact differently with each query (see Figure 2), while OpenAI instead adds a single learnable value that acts as a universal escape valve. Both successfully solve the fundamental problem: giving attention somewhere to go when it has nothing meaningful to attend to.

![SpAtten Figure](/images/blog/2025-08-09-day0-gpt-oss/spatten.png)
**Figure 3.** Initial tokens are always kept in SpAtten [2].

A similar phenomenon has been observed in BERT, where "a surprisingly large amount of attention focuses on the delimiter token [SEP] and periods. Our work SpAtten [2] in 2021, which pioneered attention score-based KV Cache pruning and quantization of attention, also found that GPT-2 preserved its initial token, as shown in Figure 3.

The attention sink mechanism we discovered [1,2] has since been adopted across the industry, appearing in production systems like OpenAI's models and inspiring new research directions in quantization and model optimization.

### GptOssMoE

For Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers, each token selects the top-4 experts based on router scores from 128 (for 120B) or 32 (for 20B) experts. The expert adopts **SwigLU** activation, and three linear layers, including gate, up, and down projections, all have bias terms enabled. The gate branch employs a **Swish** activation function with β = 1.702, and the up branch is added by 1 and multiplied with the gate output. To ensure numerical stability:

- The gate pre-activation is clipped at a maximum value of 7 before applying Swish.  
- The up branch is clipped to the range [−7, 7] before the +1 shift.

The MoE computation is summarized as:

The outputs of the top-k selected experts will be summed up with the softmax-normalized router weights.
